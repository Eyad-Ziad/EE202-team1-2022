# Notes

- Try to implement a fully defined feature and then commit.

- Do not just commit on simple things like variable name change

- Try to add more and delete less, especially if the code is not yours.

- Explain every change or addition in the message box before you commit.


Try to write something below to see if your edit is sent:

"This is an edit."
